# BOI React Docs

This app showcases React components, icons or design tokens within the monorepo.

The stories typically live adjacent to the components that they are showcasing in these docs. For example, the story for the Button component lives in packages/react-components/src/Button.

However, some stories live inside this react-docs repo itself. Examples of these would be:

- icons stories
- design tokens stories

(This is to prevent having to install various dependencies inside react-icons or design-tokens packages simply to display a story).
